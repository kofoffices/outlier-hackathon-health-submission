Feature Implementation
What makes a good implementation?
Good implementations demonstrate both functionality and aesthetics. Your project should:
Have intuitive navigation and flow
Feature attractive and consistent visual design
Function properly with all intended features working
Include clean, efficient, and well-organized code
What common errors should I avoid?


Avoid these common issues in your implementation:
Visual element mismatches (inconsistent styling across components)
Missing interactivity (non-functional buttons or features)
Incomplete UI sections (missing core functionality)
Layout problems (poor responsiveness or spacing issues)
Navigation confusion (unclear user flows)



Projects will be judged based on:
User Experience: Intuitive navigation and flow
Visual Design: Aesthetics and brand consistency
Functionality: Purpose-driven performance (i.e., it works)
Code Quality: Clean, efficient, and well-organized implementation
