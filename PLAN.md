# I'd like to refine the app experience and polish the presentation layer a bit more. Please help with the following:

# 1) Universal Navbar Integration Across All Trackers :
Refactor the app so that the main navigation bar (as seen on the homepage) is included at the top of every individual tracker page. Ensure the navbar is consistent in style, responsive, and always visible. Update the routing so users can seamlessly navigate between any tracker and the dashboard without needing to return to the homepage. Add active state highlighting for the current page.  
Make sure accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation) is preserved or improved.

# 2) Landing Page Visual & Textual Polish :
Revamp the landing page for a more elegant, award-winning look and feel, inspired by retro and gamified themes. 

- Update the main hero moto to:  
  "Gamify Your Wellness Journey - Visualize, Play, Achieve!"
- Refine the subheading to:  
  "Experience health tracking like never before: retro-inspired visuals, playful interactions, and powerful insights-all in one beautifully crafted dashboard."
- Use a pixel or arcade-inspired font only for the main headline; keep other text clean and modern for contrast.
- Add subtle animated background elements (e.g., floating pixel hearts, animated stars, or retro icons) that move slowly for depth.
- Polish the call-to-action buttons:  
  - Style "Get Started" with a glowing effect and a retro arrow icon.  
  - Style "Watch Demo" with a subtle outline and hover animation.
- Add a short tagline above the headline in a pill-shaped badge:  
  "Your Complete Health Companion"
- Below the hero image placeholder, add a row of small pixel-art icons representing each tracker (mood, hydration, sleep, etc.) with tooltips on hover.
- Add a “9 Health Trackers in One App!” badge in a retro pixel style, with a subtle bounce animation.
- Ensure all spacing, padding, and alignment are visually balanced and harmonious.
- Add a footer with pixel icons and a copyright note.

Focus on micro-interactions:  
- Animate buttons on hover and click.  
- Add a soft drop-shadow to the hero image.  
- Use a gentle gradient background that shifts slightly on scroll.

Ensure the entire landing page feels cohesive, inviting, and polished, with attention to every detail.

# 3) General Detailing and Micro-Interactions : 
Enhance the entire UI with micro-interactions and visual details:
- Add hover and focus states to all interactive elements (buttons, cards, icons).
- Use subtle animations for transitions between pages and modal openings.
- Add tooltips with helpful info on all icons and less obvious controls.
- Ensure all images and icons are crisp and retina-ready.
- Use a consistent color palette with retro-inspired accent colors.
- Review all text for clarity, conciseness, and a friendly, motivating tone.
- Make sure the design is responsive and visually pleasing on both desktop and mobile.


# 4) Accessibility and Performance :
Audit the entire app for accessibility:
- Ensure all navigation is keyboard accessible.
- Add ARIA labels where needed.
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG guidelines.
- Add skip-to-content links for screen readers.

Optimize performance:
- Lazy-load images and non-critical assets.
- Minimize bundle size and optimize code splitting.
- Use efficient CSS for animations.
