# HealthQuest — Frontend Enhancement Goals (2025)

This document tracks all ongoing and upcoming goals for elevating the HealthQuest frontend to a world-class, competition-ready standard. All enhancements will build on top of the existing architecture, preserving current features and design intent while pushing UI/UX, interactivity, and polish to the highest level.

**Goal:**  
Refine every visual and interactive detail to deliver a delightful, memorable user experience with a retro-tech, Mac-inspired aesthetic.

- Integrate pixel/arcade fonts for headings and badges, while maintaining readability for body text.
- Add micro-interactions: hover, tap, and focus states with smooth, playful animations (e.g., bounce, glow, pixel shimmer).
- Use Framer Motion for complex, interruptible animations (e.g., confetti, progress rings, modal transitions).
